# Go Scrum by Gaspar

Project for Alkemy's React Acceleration. This project consists in a Kanban-style, list-making application like Trello (https://trello.com), in which user's can make teams (with team members and a team leader) and work under the scrum methodology, posting tasks and changing their current state.

## What does the app includes?
- Register page, where you can sign up as a leader or as a team member, creating a new team or joining an already created one.
- Login page.
- Home page that shows a form to add tasks, and the tasks listed by its current state.
- Task cards, that shows a title, time stamp, state, priority, and the author of the task.
- Dark mode.

## Build with
This project was made with ReactJS and ChakraUI, using the next libraries:

- Redux (state management).
- React testing library (testing).
- Framer-motion (animations).
- Formik and Yup (form validation).
- Sweet alert.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
